# Think-Qcussion
Think - Question Discussion 

I believe that every classroom has its own unique community, especially when international students are exhibiting multicultural learning styles. I have derived this statement from 25 years of experience as a teacher, instructor and lecturer. I worked for more than eight different institutes, colleges and universities during that tenure. I taught over 23 certification and degree courses, conducted more than 19 workshops and 18 online and distance learning courses in different countries. My innovative teaching methodology, named, "Think-Qcussion" reflects the essential elements of my teaching philosophy. I divide all my teaching sessions into three parts: 

(1) Reviewing concepts and topics covered in previous sessions (5-10 minutes), 

(2) Actual teaching (theory and practice),  

(3) Determining the understanding of the concepts through Q\&A (Think-Qcussion, 10-15 minutes).


Algorithm 1 lists the step by step procedure to implement my initiative. In every practice session, I provide a hand out to the students to learn and perform the experiments independently. This practice allows them to explore different directions and learn from their mistakes if they commit any. Finally, the last part of the methodology is designed to cover the third essential element of my teaching philosophy, a two-step process covering the "think" and "qcussion" part. At the end of my teaching part, I select a random student from one of the previous day's attendance list and ask him/her to ask a question and suggest one number randomly. This is the first step in "Think-Qcussion", where the student thinks of a logical question. Now, the second selected student responds to first student's question and then asks a question and suggests a random number that will be the third student chosen from the attendance list. This is the second step in the proposed process in which discussion of concepts through questions starts, and students start churning their brain wheels. This process continues until questions related to topics covered till that session are asked and responded. This is a new version of peer-learning techniques that I named "Think-Qcussion". It is one of the best practices that students find quite comfortable to answer questions that enhance their knowledge and boost their confidence (You can find the students feedback in the teaching effectiveness section). 


Algorithm 1: Think-Qcussion {

      Procedure {
      
       Step 1 - Review the previous topics using keywords and short descriptions
       
       Step 2 - Actual Teaching
       
       Step 3 - Randomly select one student ($Stu_{i}$ ; $_{i}$ =1) from one of the previous attendance list
       
       Repeat {
       
            Step 4 - Selected student ($Stu_{i}$): will ask a question based on one topic and suggest a random number
            
            Step 5 - Student ($Stu_{i+1}$) on the selected number by the first student ($Stu_{i}$) will answer the question
            
            Step 6 - If the second student ($Stu_{i+1}$) cannot answer the question, one volunteer student will answer, otherwise, the question generator ($Stu_{i}$) will answer it
            
            Step 7 - Second student ($Stu_{i+1}$) will ask a question based on another topic proposed by the lecturer and propose a random number (which will be the third student ($Stu_{i+1+1}$) for answering the second question)
            
      } Until {All topics covered until that session}
      
     } EndProcedure
     
  } End Algorithm
